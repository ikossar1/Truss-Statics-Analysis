# Truss-Statics-Analysis

The files attached demonstrate the employment of MATLAB scripts and functions built to visualize the initial loading conditions and calculate each member's internal loadings on a truss I built. The "GenRigidBodyEquillibrium.m" function visualizes the truss members and the initial loading conditions. The "VisualizeTensionCompression.m" function visualizes the internal loadings of each truss member. The "trussplot.m" script outputs visuals of the initial loading conditions and each member's internal loadings.  

This project was completed as part of Mechanics I through Tufts University. I wrote the functions of this code in collaboration with Professor Huang.
