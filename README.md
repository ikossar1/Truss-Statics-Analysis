# Truss-Statics-Analysis
In this code file I used MATLAB scripts and functions to visualize the loadings on a truss I built to calculate the internal loadings of each member in the body. The "GenRigidBodyEquillibrium" function visualizes the truss members and the initial loading conditions. The "VisualizeTensionCompression" visualizes the internal loadings of each member of the truss. 
This project was completed as part of Mechanics I through Tufts University.
