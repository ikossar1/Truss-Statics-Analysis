# Truss-Statics-Analysis
I used MATLAB scripts and functions in this code file to visualize the loadings and calculate each member's internal loadings on a truss I built. The "GenRigidBodyEquillibrium.m" function visualizes the truss members and the initial loading conditions. The "VisualizeTensionCompression.m" function visualizes the internal loadings of each truss member. The "trussplot.m" script outputs visuals of both the initial loading conditions and internal loadings of each member. 

This project was completed as part of Mechanics I through Tufts University. I wrote the functions of this code in collaboration with Professor Huang.
